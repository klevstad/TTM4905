% I would like to thank Google for developing Google Translate, and Britta and Colin for correct Google when they're wrong.

% A special shoutout to my friends at my office for providing me with a fair amount for possible procrestination activities. I will treasure our time spent watching Norwegian slow TV and browsing the dark side of YouTube.

% Finally, I would like to thank Andreas Mosti, Software Engineer in DIPS ASA. Not for helping in any way on this thesis.
