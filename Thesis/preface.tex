Thank you speech.

%I would like to thank my supervisor, Britta Hale, and my responsible professor, Colin Boyd, for their valuable guidance and support during this thesis. You have been an incredible resource. I would also like to thank Google for developing Google Translate, and Britta and Colin for correcting Google Translate when it was wrong. A special shoutout to the random people at my office for providing me with a fair amount for possible procrastination activities. I will treasure our time spent watching Norwegian slow TV and browsing the dark side of YouTube. Writing this thesis has been challenging from time to time. Therefore, I am forever grateful for the inspiration provided by you, Doppio Passo. I could not have done this without you. Cheers.
